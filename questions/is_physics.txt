In this dataset, Physics relevance is a strict category. If the paper is narrowly about physics, this field will be true. Papers in other fields, such as math, cognitive science, or linguistics, will be marked as false.

==============================

Title (str): noisy threshold control of cell death
Abstract (str): cellular responses to death promoting stimuli typically proceed through a differentiated multistage process involving a lag phase extensive death and potential adaptation. deregulation of this chain of events is at the root of many diseases.
Physics relevance (True/False): False

Title (str): non leptonic kaon decays at large
Abstract (str): we study the scaling with the number of colours of the weak amplitudes mediating kaon mixing and decay. we evaluate the amplitudes of the two relevant current current operators on the lattice for . we conclude that the subleading corrections in are small but those in the amplitudes are large and fully anti correlated in the isospin channels. we briefly comment on the implications for the rule.
Physics relevance (True/False): True
