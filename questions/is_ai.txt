In this dataset, AI relevance is a strict category. If the paper is narrowly about artificial intelligence, this field will be true. Papers in other fields, such as math, cognitive science, or linguistics, will be marked as false.

==============================

Title (str): qualitative and quantitative estimates for minimal hypersurfaces with bounded index and area
Abstract (str): we prove qualitative estimates on the total curvature of closed minimal hypersurfaces in closed riemannian manifolds in terms of their index and area restricting to the case where the hypersurface has dimension less than seven.
AI relevance (True/False): False

Title (str): relaxations for inference in restricted boltzmann machines
Abstract (str): we propose a relaxation based approximate inference algorithm that samples near map configurations of a binary pairwise markov random field. we experiment on map inference tasks in several restricted boltzmann machines. we also use our underlying sampler to estimate the log partition function of restricted boltzmann machines and compare against other sampling based methods.
AI relevance (True/False): True
